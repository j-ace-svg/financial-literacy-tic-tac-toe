# Quick intro tutorial:
#  - Note that ` is used as a quotation mark, and shouldn't be taken literally.
#
#  - Empty lines and lines starting with `#` are ignored (allowing you to add comments/annotations to the file)
#
#  - Lines starting with `*` indicate the label for a category. This is followed by a coordinate (row, column)
#    and then label for the category. Example:
#    - `* (0, 0) First Category`
#    - Note that the spaces between the asterisk, coordinate and category name are required. Also note that
#      counting rows and columns begins with 0, not 1.
#
#  - Lines starting with a `(` are expected to be question coordinates. They contain two coordinates to mark
#    the category coordinate and sub-board coordinate, and following lines are expected to outline a question.
#    Example:
#    - `(0, 0)(0, 0)`
#    - Note the lack of space between the two coordinates. Also, as with the category coordinates, row and
#      column counting begins with 0, not 1.
#
#  - After a question is begun, the next line must be the prompt for the question. The entire line is read in as
#    the prompt, regardless of what it starts with. Example:
#    - `What is 1 + 1?`
#
#  - After a prompt, an indefinite number of answers are taken (although you should really stick with 4). Each
#    answer takes its own line, and they all start with ` - `, except for the correct answer which begins with
#    ` + `. Examples:
#    - ` - 31`
#    - ` + 2`
#
#  - An example of a complete question is as follows (a `|` notes the start of the line):
#   |(0, 0)(0, 0)
#   |What is 1 + 1?
#   | - 31
#   | + 2
#   | - 3
#   | - 1
