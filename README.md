# Installation instructions
In order to develop or run the game, you need to install python as well as pygame-ce. This can be done using the `flake.nix` file provided, or using the following pip command:
```
pip install pygame-ce
```

Please note that the game is tested with pygame-ce but not pygame, so if you choose to install pygame instead it may or may not run properly.
